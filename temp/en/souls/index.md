# Soul Traits

## Overview

The very culmination of your being. Your **Soul Trait** determines your commands, taunts and compatible [equipment](#). It also affects your [upgrade trees](../mechanics/exp.md), the substories you can partake in and most of your interactions with the world and its inhabitants. There are currently **six** Soul Traits in the game.

In spite of not being items, Souls physically manifest **one of four ways** (1) and a [rarity and archetype](../mechanics/rarities.md). A Soul's rarity and rank determines its inherent versatility and potential, though no Soul is ever strictly inferior or inherently supreme.

1.  :soul-human:{ .duality .float .subtle } — Human soul  
    :soul-monster:{ .duality .float .subtle .upside-down } — Monster soul  
    :soul-darkner:{ .duality .float .subtle } — Darkner soul

## Acquisition

You can obtain a Soul Trait one of two ways, each having its own caveat:

- The **Survey Program** is the very first method you'll encounter. It acts as the game's opening screen, where players are presented with a series of cryptic questions. Your answers determine your first Soul Trait.

- The second method is through **Dark Fountains**, which serve as the game’s gacha system. True to the genre, players can pull Souls randomly from a 'banner' — or in this case, a Fountain.

### Soul Evolution

If specific conditions are met — such as completing a quest, achieving a particular stat or defeating a certain boss, a soul may **evolve**. Evolved Souls have enhanced abilities and cannot be acquired through either the Survey Program or Dark Fountains.

This should not be confused with the [mastery system](../mechanics/combat.md#mastery), which evolve your **techniques** rather than Soul.
