# Soul Traits

## Overview

**Soul Traits** are a core mechanic, representing the very culmination of your being. They determine your available techniques and equipment, while also influencing your growth and interaction with the [world](../locations/index.md) and its [inhabitants](../npcs/index.md).

Souls manifest in one of four distinct forms:
:material-heart:{ .float .subtle }
:material-heart:{ .float .subtle .upside-down }
:material-heart-outline:{ .float .subtle }
:material-circle-slice-8:{ .float .subtle }

Each Soul is also assigned a two-faced rarity: a tier —
<span class="rarity-c">C</span>,
<span class="rarity-uc">UC</span>,
<span class="rarity-r">R</span>,
<span class="rarity-sr">SR</span>,
<span class="rarity-ssr">SSR</span>,
<span class="rarity-lr">LR</span>,
<span class="rarity-xlr">XLR</span>,
and <span class="rarity-ex">EX</span> —
and a rank (ranging from 2 to Ace) within one of four archetypes, each represented by a suit: ♠ ♥ ♦ ♣

A Soul’s rarity and rank determines its inherent versatility and potential, though no Soul is ever strictly inferior or inherently supreme.

## Acquisition

There are two ways to obtain a Soul Trait, each with its own caveats:

- The **Survey Program** (also known as the Introduction) is the very first method you'll encounter. It acts as the game's opening, where players are presented with a series of questions.  
  [:octicons-arrow-right-24: More detailed breakdown of the Survey Program](../mechanics/introduction.md)

- The second method is through **Dark Fountains**, which serve as the game’s gacha system. True to the genre, players can pull Souls randomly from a "banner" — or in this case, a Fountain.
