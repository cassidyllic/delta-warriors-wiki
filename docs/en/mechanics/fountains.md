# Gacha through Dark Fountains

## Overview

After the **introduction**, you are assigned your [Soul Trait](#); however, if you wish to change it, you must obtain a new one by drawing from a **Dark Fountain**. They operate similarly to most gacha systems, albeit with some differences — notably, your current Soul Trait is overwritten.

To draw from a Dark Fountain, you must first purchase a **Dark Coin** from [Spamton G. Spamton](#), then interact with the fountain to cast it into the darkness. Attempting to cast any other item will cause it to be spat back out and yield funny dialogue.

## Rarities

!!! info inline end "There are no Common Soul Traits!"

    You cannot draw a <span class="rarity-c">Common</span> Soul Trait from the Dark Fountains, as none exist.

    Similarly, <span class="rarity-ex">Exclusive</span> Soul Traits cannot be drawn, as they are only obtainable through limited-time quests or bosses.

During weekends (from Friday to Sunday), rarer Soul Traits become easier to draw, while more common Soul Traits are drawn less frequently.
