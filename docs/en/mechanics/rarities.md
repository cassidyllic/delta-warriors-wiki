# Rarities and Archetypes

## Overview

Rarities follow a three-component system, whereby each [item](#), each [equipment](#), and each [Soul Trait](#) is assigned a **rarity**, an **archetype** and a **rank** within that archetype.

There are **eight** rarities, **four** archetypes and **thirteen** ranks.

## Rarities

!!! info inline end "Rarities are normalised!"

    All rarities are normalised, which means all <span class="rarity-lr">LR</span> items have a 2.5% chance, and so forth.

    The only exception is the odds from the [Dark Fountains](./fountains.md), which do not include <span class="rarity-c">Common</span> Soul Traits and offer more generous odds during the **weekend**.

Seven of the eight rarities can be obtained through normal gameplay. The remaining rarity, <span class="rarity-ex">Exclusive</span>, is only available during Seasonal Events.

| :--------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------: |
|            <span class="rarity-c">Common</span>            |      35%      |
|          <span class="rarity-uc">Uncommon</span>           |      25%      |
|             <span class="rarity-r">Rare</span>             |      20%      |
|         <span class="rarity-sr">Super Rare</span>          |      10%      |
|     <span class="rarity-ssr">Super Special Rare</span>     |      7%       |
|       <span class="rarity-lr">Legendary Rare</span>        |     2.5%      |
| <span class="rarity-xlr">Exalted<br/>Legendary Rare</span> |     0.5%      |
|          <span class="rarity-ex">Exclusive</span>          | Not available |

## Archetypes and Ranks

The four archetypes correspond to the four suits in a deck of playing cards (1), each representing a distinct playstyle. Each is also assigned a rank from 2 to Ace, with higher ranks indicating greater efficiency within that particular archetype.

1.  - :material-cards-spade: **Special-Type**: Items that don't fit neatly into the other categories.  
    - :material-cards-heart: **Support-Type**: Items focused on healing, buffing or otherwise aiding allies.  
    - :material-cards-club: **Power-Type**: Items focused on simple, close-quarter raw damage.  
    - :material-cards-diamond: **Control-Type**: Items that grant a higher degree of control over the battlefield.



Additionally, the rank is also expressed as a star rating, with 2 corresponding to a **one-star** item and Ace to a **thirteen-star** item.
