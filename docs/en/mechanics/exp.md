# Experience and Upgrading

## Overview

As you play the game, you’ll earn **three distinct types of experience** (1) (Also called **SP**), each represented by a different colour. These points can be used to **enhance** your base stats or **unlock** new techniques.

1.  - <span class="endurance">:material-chess-rook: Endurance</span> — Also known as **ESP**.
    - <span class="strength">:material-chess-knight: Strength</span> — Also known as **SSP**.
    - <span class="technique">:material-chess-bishop: Technique</span> — Also known as **TSP**.

You’ll earn experience through: combat, completing quests, earning trophies …and nearly any other activity in the game.

## Upgrading

You can spend your Stat Points to improve your character through **three separate upgrade trees**. As there is no level system or cap on Stat Points, you will ultimately be able to unlock all upgrades.

When switching to a different [Soul Trait](#), your **Soul** and **Technique** trees will be reset. However, your upgrades are saved, so if you return to a previous Soul Trait, you won’t have to re-grind them.

=== "Body Tree"

    The **Body Tree** contains **universal** upgrades that are shared by all Soul Traits.
